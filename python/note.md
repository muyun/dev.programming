### Python
#### Python Data Model - A Framework/API for core language constructs

Python interpreter invokes special methods to perform basic object operations.

By using and implementing special methods of Python Data Model in your objects, your objects can **behave like the built-in types**, enabling the expressive coding style **Pythonic**.

#### Data Sturctures
  - sequences
  - mappings
  - sets
  - str versus bytes
  
#### Functions as objects

#### Object Oriented

#### Control flow


#### Metaprogramming 


#### virtualenvs setup for python3
Your environment contains PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
This doesn't work with Python 3 for obvious reasons. To remove it:
> unset PYTHONPATH
